This app will automatically add to my "GitHub.com" a new repository.
Its interface is designed using Flet, and it sails Google Chrome using Selenium Chromedriver,
for adding the repository to the website.
Also, all the git commands to complete adding, (add the script, add a description and commit all, etc...),
will be executed in terminal, using Applescript.
